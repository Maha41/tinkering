Deploying .NET Application using

(i) Jenkins server which uses MS build and AWS code deploy plugin -> cicd-windows-master.yaml (WIP as Jenkin Instance crashes during stack set up)

Why Jenkins -

Jenkins is an open source automation server 
Jenkins supports a connection to an LDAP repository. 
Jenkins supports an external data store that can be made highly available. 
Jenkins includes a distributed build configuration optionl and can be restored from the raw AMI at any point, with a data import to restore data if necessary.
